Introduction

The purpose of this study is to investigate the mortality experience of individuals aged 70 years old and over, as well as those in the 0-49 years old age group in Quebec during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The investigation utilizes individual level deaths records from Institut de la statistique du Qu√©bec (ISQ). The data include weekly mortality counts from all causes, spanning from January 1st, 2010, to October 21st, 2020. 
The mortality counts are categorized into three age groups, which are 0-49 years old, 50-69 years old, 70 years old and over. Excess mortality is measured based on historical data, representing the extent to which total mortality (from all causes) deviates from mortality expected in the absence of the pandemic.
